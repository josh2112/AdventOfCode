abcde
-----
swap position 4 with position 0:       ebcda
swap letter d with letter b:           edcba
reverse positions 0 through 4:         abcde
rotate left 1 step:                    bcdea
move position 1 to position 4:         bdeac
move position 3 to position 0:         abdec
rotate based on position of letter b:  ecabd
rotate based on position of letter d:  decab

decab
-----
rotate based on position of letter d:
  1 + x (+1 if x >= 4)
  0 => 1
  1 => 2
  2 => 3
  3 => 4
  4 => 6 (% 5 = 1)
  5 => 7 (% 5 = 2)
  6 => 8 (% 5 = 3)
  7 => 9  (% 5 = 4)
  d was 4 => 6, so 1. rotating 1 got it to 0
rotate based on position of letter b:
move position 3 to position 0:
move position 1 to position 4:
rotate left 1 step: 
reverse positions 0 through 4:
swap letter d with letter b:
swap position 4 with position 0:

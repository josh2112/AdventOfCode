Part 1:
Run Dijkstra backwards - 'visited' is then a dict of locations with their distance from end.
For each point p1 in visited:
  For each wall around that point:
    For each point p2 around that wall:
      If p2 distance-to-end (from visited) is more than 2 greater than p1 distance-to-end:
        this is a valid cheat, cost saved = diff - 2

Modification for part 2:
  For each point p1 in visited:
    For each valid point p2 that is 20 or less away from p1:
      If visited[p2] is more than dist(p2->p1) greater than visited[p1]:
        this is a valid cheat, cost saved = diff - dist(p2->p1)

Might also even adapt that to part 2, just with points exactly 2 away instead of 1-20

num sides = num corners
num convex corners = num contiguous borders - 1
 - A and D have 3 contiguous borders, so 2 + 2 = 4 corners
 - B and C have 2 contiguous borders, so 1 + 1 = 2 corners
 num concave borders = num different diagonals between adjacent neighbors
  - B has 2 adjacent neighbors (A and C) with a different diagonal (E) so 1 corner
  - C has 2 adjacent neighbors (B and D) with a different diagonal (F) so 1 corner
sum = 8 corners

each B has 2 contiguous borders, so 1 * 4 = 4
no concave borders (each B has 2 adjacent neighbors, but diagonal is also B)
